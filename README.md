[![Build Status](https://github.com/TGNThump/ActivityStreams4J/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TGNThump/ActivityStreams4J/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI+with+Maven%22)

**ActivityStreams4J** is a Java library consisting of DTOs for the [W3C ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specification, along with the [ActivityPub extension](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#activitypub).

These DTOs are annotated with [Java OWL Persistence API (JOPA)](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/kbss/jopa) annotations, designed to work with [Java Binding for JSON-LD](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jb4jsonld) and automatically tested against the example inputs from the W3C technical reports for [ActivityStreams Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), [ActivityStreams Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).
