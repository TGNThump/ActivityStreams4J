**ActivityStreams4J** is a Java library consisting of DTOs for the [W3C ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specification.

These DTOs are annotated with [Java OWL Persistence API (JOPA)](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/kbss/jopa) annotations, designed to work with [Java Binding for JSON-LD](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jb4jsonld) and tested against the W3C [ActivityStreams Test Documents](https://github.com/w3c/activitystreams/tree/master/test).
